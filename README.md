# **World_Weather_Analysis**
- Analyse weather data for countries around the world to plan for a trip using API calls to OpenWeatherMap and gMaps. 
- Using Pandas came up with 2000 random latitude - longitude pairs across the world. 
- Use the latitude-longitude pairs to get closest city and get the desired weather data from OpenWeatherMap API response. Achieved to get atleast 500 cities from 2000 lat-long pairs.

- From the marker layer map, allow the user to pick 4 cities for a round about trip within a single country.
- Passing the info of the selected 4 cities to gMaps Directions API, plot a directions layer map.
- Plot a marker layer map with pop-up marker for each of these 4 cities.
